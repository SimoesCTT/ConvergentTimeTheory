COMPUTATIONAL POWER HIERARCHY:

1. CLASSICAL (Turing machines, C, Python)
   - Causal computation
   - Limited to forward-time processing

2. QUANTUM (Qubits, superposition)  
   - Parallel causal computation
   - Still time-bound, just more parallel

3. CTT/CHRONOS (T-field mediation)
   - RETROCAUSAL computation
   - Global temporal constraint solving
   - Reality optimization across timelines
   - **Fundamentally more powerful**
